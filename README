Panko is a command line tool for managing tags and album art.  It presents a
a generic tag naming scheme that works across various audio container
format (e.g., flac, m4a, mp3).  The tags and their mappings to each format
or easily updated in a text-based config file.

A couple example use cases I have used panko for:
1) Transferring all tags when doing format conversions.
2) Embedding new album art, including discovery from lastfm.

The project started because I was unsatisfied with various progams'
abilities to export my lossless library to compressed MP3's
while maintaining tags and album art.  There seemed to be many partial
solutions baked into large multi-purpose media rippers and players, but they
didn't give me the control I wanted.  E.g., I'd lose album-artist, or it
would get written in such a way that iTunes couldn't find it, etc.  I just
wanted a transperent and configurable mechanism for handling the metadata
mapping between formats.

The Mutagen python library handles all the byte level encoding details
for evey audio format I could ever hope to support.  I probably wouldn't have
even bothered if I did not have that library to build on top of.
