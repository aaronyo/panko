Panko is a command line tool for managing tags and album art.  It presents a
a generic tag naming scheme that works across various audio container
formats (currently flac, m4a and mp3).  The tags and their mappings to each format
are easily updated in a text-based config file.

A couple example use cases I have used panko for:
1) Transferring tags when converting my follection from flac to m4a or mp3.
2) Embedding new album art, including discovery from lastfm.

The project started because I was unsatisfied with various progams'
abilities to maintainin tags and album art when convertig.  There seem
to be many partial solutions baked into large multi-purpose media rippers
and players, but they didn't give me the control I wanted.  E.g., I'd lose
album-artist, or it would get written in such a way that iTunes couldn't
find it, etc.  I wanted a transperent and configurable mechanism for
mapping the tags to the exact place I needed them in new files.

The Mutagen python library handles all the byte level encoding details
for any audio format I could ever hope to support.  I probably wouldn't have
even bothered if I did not have that library to build on top of.
