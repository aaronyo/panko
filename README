Panko is a command line tool for managing tags and album art.  It presents a
a generic tag naming scheme that works across various audio container
formats (currently flac, m4a and mp3).  The tags and their mappings to each format
are easily updated in a text-based config file.

A few example use cases I have used panko for:
1) Copying tags when converting my follection from flac to m4a or mp3.
2) Embedding new album art, including discovery from lastfm.
3) Finding files with duplicate audio bytes (ignoring tags in the comparison).

The project started because I was unsatisfied with various progams'
abilities to maintainin tags and album art when convertig.  There seem
to be many partial solutions baked into large multi-purpose media rippers
and players, but they didn't give me the control I wanted.  E.g., I'd lose
album-artist, or it would get written in such a way that iTunes couldn't
find it, etc.  I wanted a transperent and configurable mechanism for
mapping the tags to the exact place I needed them in new files.

The Mutagen python library handles all of the byte level encoding details
for reading and writing meta data.  I probably wouldn't have even bothered
if I did not have that library to build on top of, so, thank you Mutagen.
